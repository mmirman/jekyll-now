I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich as part of the Software Reliability Lab since January 2017.

### Research Interests ###

I am researching AI as viewed as differentiable programming through the lense of programming language techniques. This encompasses both applications of program analysis techniques for to learning systems and construction of deep learning systems using the constructs developed in the area of programming language design. Historically, I've done research on metaprogramming using first class type inference, and computational geometry.

### Projects ###

* [Caledon:](https://github.com/mmirman/caledon)
A higher order meta-programming logic language typed by a pure type system with an infinite universe heirarchy and first class type inference.

* [Forward-Chan:](https://github.com/mmirman/forward-chan) 
An implementation of a more general "forward" primitive used in the identity rule for the proof terms of the sequent calculus formulation of linear logic, based on traditional channel primitives and mutation.

* [ImperativeHaskell:](https://github.com/mmirman/imperativehaskell) 
Proof that haskell can look and act like an imperative language, with a diverse set of imperative primitives

* [RPC-framework:](https://github.com/mmirman/rpc-framework) 
An RPC library for haskell that makes construction of anonymous services both well typed and easy to use, with a modal typed seperating worlds api. Only works with older GHC versions.

* [Conpig:](https://github.com/mmirman/conpig) 
An alternative green threading library for python that automates more of the concurrency.

* [Raskell:](https://github.com/mmirman/raskell) 
linear and ordered typed tagless DSLs.
